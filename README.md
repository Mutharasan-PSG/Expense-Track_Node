The Expense Tracker App is a comprehensive tool designed to help users manage their finances effectively. It allows users to log their income by adding details like description and date, and track their expenses with information such as amount, description, category, and date. The app also supports uploading images as proof of expenses, which can be easily viewed later. Users can modify or update their income and expense records whenever needed. To provide better insights, the app features a visualization tool that displays expenses in a chart categorized by spending types for a selected time period. Additionally, the dashboard offers a clear summary of total income, total expenses, and the remaining balance, making it easy to stay on top of finances.
